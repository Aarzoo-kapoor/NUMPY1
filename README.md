# NUMPY1
This repo has been created to highlight the start of my AI-ML journey and to begin this wonderful journey, the first stop (after learning python) is to learn python libraries such as Numpy,Pandas,etc. This repo contains a very basic beginner level project for Numpy!

#Data Analysis with NumPy
Let's consider a practical data analysis task. Imagine we have a dataset that represents the sales performance of a company over 12 months, with sales data and associated information (like expenses or profits). Our goal is to perform some basic data analysis tasks, such as:
1. Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
2. Identify the highest profit month with profit number and lowest sale with sale number.
